* Read from a file the substitution matrix. Using the matrix in tabular format (a square complete matrix)generate a list made of lists where each list is a row of the matrix.
* Make a function to build a dictionary starting from the list of lists. We initialize an empty dictionary and then use two "for cicle" to fill it. 
* Define a scoring function able of giving us a score of the alignment of two sequences of the same length, given as parameters the two sequences and the dictionary. It has to take into account the presence of gaps following a linear model (d=-2). If the gap is present the score will decrease by 2, else it will increase as much as the value given in the dictionary for that specific pair. The function will return score and the two sequences aligned. 
* Eventually we can read the alignment from a file and use them as input for the previous function. I store the sequences in a list of strings. Using this list with a for in range (0, len(list), 2) I can do the alignment between the first and the second, the third and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth.
